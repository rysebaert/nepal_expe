This website proposes some data visualizations of the fabulous **Himalayan database**, a compilation of records for all expeditions in Nepal Himalaya. It takes the form of a dashboard where user can explore several dimensions of indicators included in the database. 

A section is dedicated to peak data visualization with some indicators (height, ascent number, first ascent, sherpa hired rate, death rates, etc.). It includes only peaks above 6700 m, due to lack of time (173 peaks over the 479 of the Himalayan database). But this selection cover most of the recorded expeditions (10337 over the 11323 included in the database). 

Another is dedicated to expedition members, aggregated a country level for several time periods. For this dataset, all expeditions are included (also ascent below 6700m). It covers 87156 recorded expedition members and 40785 unique persons (some indivuals making several ascents). 

The technical aim of this website is to test the integration of .ojs and .R workflows in quarto dashboards. 


## The Himalayan Database

The [Himalayan Database](http://www.himalayandatabase.com/) is a compilation of records for all expeditions that have climbed in the Nepal Himalaya. The database is based on the expedition archives of Elizabeth Hawley, a longtime journalist based in Kathmandu, and it is supplemented by information gathered from books, alpine journals and correspondence with Himalayan climbers.

The data cover all expeditions from 1905 through Autumn-Winter 2023 to the most significant mountaineering peaks in Nepal. Also included are expeditions to both sides of border peaks such as Everest, Cho Oyu, Makalu and Kangchenjunga as well as to some smaller border peaks. Data on expeditions to trekking peaks are included for early attempts, first ascents and major accidents.

Each expedition record contains detailed information including dates, routes, camps, use of supplemental oxygen, successes, deaths and accidents.

Each expedition record contains biographical information for all members listed on the permit as well as for hired members (e.g., Sherpas) for which there are significant events such as a summit success, death, accident or rescue.

In 2024 (Autumn - Winter 2023 update), this database includes 479 peals, more than 11300 expedition records, 87100 members records
